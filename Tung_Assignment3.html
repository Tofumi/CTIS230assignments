      <h4>Change’s in Firm’s Demand</h4>
      <p>From last year’s drop from the bursting of the cryptocurrency bubble, Nvidia grew both on revenue and market value after they recovered from the drop. Both the revenue from their GTX/RTX graphical processing units increases due to the higher demand of gamers. The more expensive RTX graphic cards which cost around 1000 dollars actually have a larger margin in their demand increase. This is mainly caused by the fact that Nvidia's major gaming graphic card competitor Advanced Micro Devices Inc.’s high-end products do not perform as good as Nvidia's GTX units at the same price. This is a major demand shifter as the customers prefer the better unit for the same price. “Gaming revenue was down 6% year over year but improved 26% sequentially in the last quarter.” It also got boosted earlier last year due to the new Nintendo’s handheld gaming console Switch Lite’s release. “Nintendo said it sold 1.95 million of the devices in the third quarter, helping Nvidia’s gaming segment to a 26% revenue increase compared with the second quarter.” Their demand increased a lot due to the popularity of relating goods.
