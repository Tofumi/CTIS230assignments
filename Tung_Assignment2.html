<h1>Company Description, Demand, Costs, Nvidia</h1>


<h2>Company Description</h2>
<p class = "nvidia">Nvidia was founded in 1993 by <em>Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky</em>, and <em>Curtis Priem</em> believing that the personal computer would be the platform for entertainment and multimedia. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California it is the only currently independently operating company producing graphical processing units that are used in a variety of ways ranging from personal computers, data centers, artificial intelligence, and automotive. The company’s best selling products consist of their GTX/RTX graphical processing units for personal computers and their Tesla and Volta Tensor Core for applications of motor vehicles and the world’s fastest servers and supercomputers. Nvidia’s revenue for the year 2019 was 11.72 billion dollars which are up from 9.71 billion dollars in 2018. Furthermore, Nvidia has experienced a gross profit increase to 7.17 billion dollars in 2019 which is also up from 5.82 billion in 2018. In regards to market position, Nvidia is the only independently run operating in the world currently and is number one in discrete GPU sales which means that their graphics cards don’t have integrated graphics. Based on market share on the number of shipments, Nvidia controls currently 67.9% of the market sales worldwide followed by one of their leading competitors, AMD. However, the types of processing units that are sold between these companies are different, thus the numbers don’t tell the full story of exactly what the sales numbers are in relation to a specific type of graphics unit. As mentioned, Nvidia’s leading competitors consist of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel however, there are key differences between each companies products. Intel is the main producer of Central Processing Units and has their own Intel Graphics that don’t require a GPU, furthermore, AMD makes both CPUs and GPUs but lack the higher-end computing performance that Nvidia has and controls.

<h2>Production Processes, Inputs, and Costs</h2>
	<p class = "nvidia">Currently, Nvidia has 55 office locations and facilities in 22 different countries and spanning 3 continents. There are facilities located primarily on the west and east coast of the United States, Japan, Korea, India, France, and Germany. Nvidia outsources most if not all of the components needed to build their Units. One major partner that Nvidia relies on to physically build the chips needed in their GPUs is the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Nvidia then compiles all the components made from other companies and puts it together to form Nvidia graphics cards. As of 2019, Nvidia’s operating costs compose of close to 50% of its gross profit. Their costs consist of fixed costs like land, rent, buildings, factories, and equipment. Their main variable costs consist of employee wages, advertising, and primary research and development. This is reflected by 78% of its employees being technology related meaning that Nvidia is seeking to technologically advance and constantly develop faster, more reliable graphics processing units. In the past 5 years, Nvidia’s costs have been steadily increasing in both variable and fixed costs departments. Operating costs have increased from about 2 billion in 2014 to almost 4 billion in 2019. The same trend can be seen in their variable cost of revenue which has also increased from less than 2 billion in 2014 to almost 5 billion in 2019. Furthermore, both Nvidia’s per-unit costs and overall costs are increasing as they look to upgrade to better components for their products and hope to expand which means hiring more people and setting up facilities in more cities worldwide in order to capture their desired market hold.
